# PowerBI Project

Worked with PowerBI to get the data from an excel sheet, modify the data, and create visualizations and a dashboard for the same.

Tasks accomplished:
1. Removing unnecessary data
2. Converting age into age ranges and converted salary ranges to average values for visualization purposes


Created visualizations to explore:
1. Average salary distribution by age, gender as well as by the job title.
2. Geological distribution of survey takers
3. Satisfaction of survey takers w.r.t salary
4. Highest level of education
5. Preferred programming language as per Job title and Industry
6. Ease of breaking into a field with data
7. Perks preferred when looking out for a new job

Worked on getting the data from MySQL to PowerBI and creating a dashboard containing visualization elements such as:
1. Cards for Total Shipments, Sales, Boxes and Percentage of Shipment containing low boxes
2. Sales by Category, Category and Location, and sales by country

4. Sales trend over Jan 2021 to Jan 2022
5. Created a slicer to filter all the visualizations based on selected Category
